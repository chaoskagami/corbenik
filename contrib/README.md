Contributed patches
----------------------

This directory is for any patches not part of the official distribution and potentially contributed by users. Anything in here must be distributed under the GPLv3, otherwise it cannot be included. I'll make an effort to maintain these as part of the official release zips, but these may not have the same quality standards as `patch/` due to being non-essential to operation.

If you want your patch in the release zips, submit a PR! As long as it does what it says on the tin can and uses GPLv3 as the license, I'll merge it. ;P I can only hope someday this becomes a useful repository of patches for people.
