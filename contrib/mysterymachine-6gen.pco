# This is for sixth-gen pokemon games, and points mystery gift
# to SALT's servers. See here:
#   http://mys.salthax.org/
# This performs the same patching done by the official HANS-based
# patcher here:
#   https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/MysteryMachine-Patcher
# You do not need to use HBLauncher to use this, either. ;P

# This patch was originally created by @Wolfvak although there's
# really only one way to implement it. Forward all kudos to him.

# I extended it to the other games using newer VM features - that's
# about it.
